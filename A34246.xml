            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Confeſſion of Faith OF THE ROMAN CATHOLICKS in <hi>IRELAND.</hi> For the refuſing of which, <hi>Many Proteſtants are Perſecuted, others who cannot ſwallow their damnable Principles which are impoſed on them, fly into</hi> England, <hi>and are kindly relieved by His Majeſty's Subjects.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. WE Acknowlege and Confeſs, that by the ſingular Care of our ſupreme Magiſtrates, Spiritual and Temporal, and by them and the diligence of the Lord of the Country, <hi>J. T.</hi> we are only deduced from the Heretical way and faith, to the true Roman Catholick and ſaving way; and that we embrace the ſame freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily without any force or compulſion, and we would have all the World to take notice hereof.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We Confeſs the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Head of the Church, and that he cannot Err.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We Confeſs, and are ſure that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is Vicar of Chriſt, and that he hath full power at his pleaſure over all Men, of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and Retaining Sin, and of Excommunicating and Caſting into Hell.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We Confeſs, that whatſoever the Pope ſhall Inſtitute anew, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within or without the Scripture, and alſo whatſoever he ſhall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to be Divine and Saving; and therefore to be more eſteemed than the Precepts of the Living God by all Lay-people.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We Confeſs the moſt holy Pope ought by all Men to be honoured with honour, with greater bowing of the Knee than is due to Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. We Confeſs and Aſſert, that the Pope ought to be heard by all Men in all things, as the moſt Holy Father, without exception, according to the Direction of his Inſtitutions, and whoſoever ſhall do on the contrary; ſuch Hereticks, without pity, are not only to be Burnt, but both Body and Soul to be Caſt into Hell.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. We Confeſs that the Reading of the ſacred Scripture is the riſe of Hereſie and Sects, and the original of Blaſphemies.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. We Confeſs that it is good, profitable, holy, and ſaving, to pray to Saints, whether Men or Women, that are Dead, to honour their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to bow the Knee before them, to go on Pilgrimage to them, to cloath them, and burn lights to them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. We Confeſs that every Prieſt is much greater than the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God, which only once brought forth Chriſt and no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Roman Prieſt, not only while he will, but when he will, offers and makes Chriſt, and alſo being Created conſumes him.</p>
            <p n="10">X. We Confeſs that it is profitable and ſaving to Celebrate Maſſes, to give Alms, and to pray for the Dead.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. We Confeſs the Roman Pope to have power at his pleaſure to change the Scripture, or to add to it or diminiſh from it.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. We Confeſs that Souls after Death are purged in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the Maſſes of Prieſts are helpful for their Deliverance.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57785:2"/>
            <p n="13">XIII. We Confeſs that it is good and ſaving to partake of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> under one kind, but to partake in both kinds is Heretical and Damnable.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. We Confeſs and Aſſert, that thoſe who uſe to partake in one kind, do uſe and partake of whole Chriſt with his Fleſh and Blood, and with his Deity and Bones, but thoſe who partake under both kinds, only feed upon and enjoy the bread.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. We Confeſs that there are Seven Real and true Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. We Confeſs that God is honoured in Images, and by them is owned of Men.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. We Confeſs that the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is worthy of more honour from Men and Angels than Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. We Confeſs that the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is the Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that ſhe reigns, together with her Son, according to whoſe pleaſure the Son ought to do all things.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. We Confeſs that the Bones of the Saints have great virtue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould be honoured by Men, and have Chapels built to them.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. We Confeſs the Roman Doctrine to be Catholick and Pure, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Saving, Ancient and True; but the Evangelical Doctrine (from which we freely recede) to be falſe, erroneous, blaſphemous, curſed, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, damnable, ſeditious, and wicked, deviſed and feigned; wherefore, ſeeing the Roman Religion under one kind is wholly and ſully ſaving and good, therefore we Curſe all thoſe who inſtructed us in that Hereſie, as perverſe and wicked under both kinds; we pronounce our Parents accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which Educated us in that Heretical Faith, and we Curſe them which cauſed us to doubt of the <hi>Roman Catholick Faith;</hi> likewiſe thoſe too which adminiſtred to us of that curſed Cup: Yea, we Curſe our own ſelves, and do pronounce our ſelves accurſed, becauſe we did partake of that Curſed and Heretical Cup of which we ought not to have done.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. We Confeſs that the Holy Scripture is imperfect and a dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo far as it is not explained by the Pope, and granted by him to be read by the Lay people.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. We Confeſs that one Maſs of the Roman Prieſt is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than a hundred and more Sermons of the Evangelical Miniſters, and therefore we Curſe thoſe Books which we have read, which contain that Heretical and Blaſphemous Doctrine, and we bring a Curſe upon all thoſe Works committed while we abode in that Heretical Faith, leſt they ſhould procure any thing to us before God in the laſt Day.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. We do all theſe things out of a pure heart, aſſerting that the Roman Church, in theſe and the like Articles, is moſt true, with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn renunciation of that Heretical Doctrine, before you, Reverend Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Fathers, before you, honourable Men, honourable Matrons, young Men and Virgins preſent; and moreover, we ſwear we will not, as long as we live, though it might be lawful for us, turn again to that Heretical Doctrine under both kinds, and we do alſo ſwear that ſo long as a drop of blood remains in our Bodies, we will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſecute that curſed Evangelical Doctrine, every way both openly and ſecretly, violently and frequenly, by Word and Deed, and by the Sword alſo.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, we Swear (on ſuppoſition that a change happen, either in the Temporal or Spiritual State abroad) before God, Angels, and you preſent, that we will never for fear or favour, depart from this ſaving <hi>Roman Catholick Faith</hi> and <hi>Holy Church,</hi> nor ever return to embrace that curſed Evangelical Hereſie.</p>
